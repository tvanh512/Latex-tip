\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}
\begin{document}
The set of real numbers are usually represented 
by a blackboard bold capital r: $\R$
\end{document}

The statement \newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}} has two parameters that define a new command

\R 
This is the name of the new command.
\mathbb{R} 
This is what the new command does. In this case the letter R will be written in blackboard boldface style. (to use mathbb is needed the package amssymb)
